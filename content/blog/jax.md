### Our interview with Jax Plus

This extraordinary and unique soluble fiber is rich in arabinoxylans. By adding JAXplus to Piada, its fiber acts as a protective armor that coats glucose molecules, slowing their absorption by the body and avoiding glycemic spikes. JAXplus is a patent by Heallo Solutions-
This makes Piada an excellent product even for those who need to control their blood glucose levels.

To start off this partnership, Giordana was interviewed by the Jax Plus team to find out more about Food4Future, Piada and how Jax Plus helps us deliver our innovative nutritional piadina.

The idea of Piada stems from the curious mind of Giordana, a sociologist passionate about Food Culture and innovative nutrition. We will discover the main motivations behind this project, the secrets that make Piada unique and healthy, and the role of JAXplus® in this innovation.

### Let’s start from the beginning: how did the idea of creating Food4Future and developing Piada come about?

My professional journey diverges from the typical background of those working in the food industry. As a sociologist passionate and always curious about **trends and nutrition**, I nurtured the desire to delve deeper, study, and experiment. After spending several years in Sweden, where I managed a traditional Italian tavern, I felt compelled to introduce something new: an idea inspired by Italy but capable of respecting fundamental criteria such as **taste, health, innovation, and sustainability**. And that’s how Food4Future was born.

### What was your main motivation behind this project?

I wanted to conceive something **delicious and healthy**, a product that could satisfy the palate while being beneficial for our physical well-being. Too often, the standards of a healthy diet have been distant from the concept of taste. I wanted something that would make you want to eat it again and again!

### Piada has been described as an innovative piadina from a nutritional standpoint. What are the key elements that make it so unique and healthy?

I believe the key elements are the use of **lupin flour** as a protein source and the soluble fiber JAXplus®. In addition, there are the benefits of whole grains and seeds in the mix, providing a supply of polyunsaturated fats and polyphenols.

JAXplus® has been an amazing surprise, giving a phenomenal boost to Piada.

Thanks to the soluble fiber JAXplus®, we have the opportunity to bring to the Italian and Swedish markets the first low glycemic index protein piadina JAXplus®. This soluble fiber, rich in Arabinoxylans, extracted from by-products of wheat processing and dosed at 5% of the carbohydrate content in the product, as suggested by the European Food Safety Authority, is a fundamental component of Piada.

### Have there been any obstacles encountered in the process of developing this product?

I would say no! From the start, there was a synergy that led to a smooth and fruitful collaboration. And this is just the beginning of a relationship that will give rise to a truly interesting product line.

### How did you tackle the challenges related to the research and development of such an innovative product?

We faced them with as much fear as determination. With hundreds of trials, tests, and formula changes until we achieved what we believe to be a great product. A process that saw an **almost all-female team** combining passions and skills, of which I am very proud.

### What have been the reactions of consumers and experts in the food industry so far?

We spent a year “on the road” in Sweden, testing PIADA directly on a **food truck**. We received positive feedback and suggestions from consumers. Experts analyzed the formula and were pleasantly surprised and enthusiastic. **A great result**, I would say!

### Speaking of social and environmental impact, how does PIADA fit into the mission of Food4Future and Heallo to promote a healthy and sustainable diet?

Food4Future strongly aims to detach from “**diet culture**”, which penalizes and guilt-trips food while simultaneously encouraging the consumption of “empty” and ultra-processed food that promises to be healthy.

**PIADA is simple, real food, yet innovative, and the innovation comes from simply natural ingredients**. Thanks to innovative technological processes, it’s possible to add a 100% natural ingredient, JAXplus®, making PIADA **suitable for daily consumption**.

We know that our diet, too rich in refined carbohydrates and sugars, is not healthy and sustainable on various fronts. The increase in chronic-degenerative diseases, diabetes, and obesity should urge us to find new solutions. They exist and come from the earth, and above all, we can recover them from agro-industrial processing residues. Increasing the consumption of plant-based proteins and soluble fibers, which specifically limit the impact of glucose in our bodies, are the keys to the future of nutrition.

### What are the next steps for Food4Future and the development of new innovative products with Heallo?

The next step, after launching in the Swedish market, will be the Italian market, which is more demanding but ready because the Italian consumer is attentive and knowledgeable. **Piada**, fueling a synergy that has been created thanks to the immediate affinities that characterized us. We will continue with a baked product and, why not, pasta, the queen of our tables. We will create pasta that is both delicious and has a low glycemic impact for those who don’t want to give up Italian flavor.
