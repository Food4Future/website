  ## Our love for natural ingredients

  Piada is powered by Food4Future. It is an innovative flat bread. The key elements
  are the use of lupin flour as source of protein and the fiber JAXplus to reduce the
  glucose impact.

      #### Lupin 

      The star legume of Piada whose main nutritional properties are related to protein, fiber, micronutrients, and fats such as omega-3 and omega-6. Thanks to these substances, lupines are a nourishing, energetic, and satiating food.

      #### Oats 

      We've chosen this valuable grain, traditionally part of the diet of Northern European populations, appreciated for its protein content, lack of gluten, and high soluble fiber, especially beta-glucans and its intake of vitamin B1.

      #### Spelt

      It's the grain most similar to wheat but with much less gluten, low in fat, and has a low glycemic index compared to other cereal varieties. Spelt's true wealth lies in its fibers, which increase the feeling of satiety and aid digestion.

      #### JAXplus Fiber

      This extraordinary and unique soluble fiber is rich in arabinoxylans. By adding JAXplus to Piada, its fiber acts as a protective armor that coats glucose molecules, slowing their absorption by the body and avoiding glycemic spikes. JAXplus is a patent by Heallo Solutions.
